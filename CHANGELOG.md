# Changelog

This document contains a historical list of changes between releases. Only
changes that impact end-user behavior are listed; changes to documentation or
internal API changes are not present.

Main (unreleased)
-----------------

### Enhancements

- Allow the `[]` operator to return `null` when accessing non-existant keys in
  objects, rather than returning an error. For example, `{}["foo"]` now returns
  `null`. (@rfratto)

### Bugfixes

- Fix a bug where indexing an object with a non-string key would generate a
  type error informing users to supply a `number` instead of the actually
  expected `string` type. (@rfratto)

v0.2.0 (2023-10-20)
-------------------

### Features

- Add support for raw strings in river using backticks (@erikbaranowski)

### Other changes

- Fix typos and expand README for documentation.

- `token/builder`: Update River encode handling of optional fields to compare values using
  DeepEqual even if they don't implement Equal when deciding if the field
  should be included. (@erikbaranowski)
